<p><a name = "start" id = "start">This text</a> uses UTF-8 (Unicode)
file encoding. If the apostrophes and quotation marks in this paragraph
appear as garbage, you may have an incompatible browser or unavailable
fonts. First, make sure that your browser’s “character set” or “file
encoding” is set to Unicode (UTF-8). You may also need to change the
default font.</p>

<p>The Gairdner edition of the Paston Letters was printed in six
volumes.
Each volume is a separate e-text; Volume VI is further divided into two
e-texts, Letters and Index. Volume&nbsp;I, the General Introduction,
will be released after all other volumes, matching the original
publication order.</p>

<p>All brackets are in the original, as are parenthetical question marks
and (<i>sic</i>) notations. Series of dots representing damaged text are
shown as printed. Note that the printed book used <b>z</b> to represent
original yogh <b>ȝ</b>. This has not been changed for the e-text. The
copy number (first page of each volume) is hand-written.</p>

<p>The year of each letter was printed in a sidenote at the top of the
page; this has been merged with the sidenote at the beginning of each
letter. Footnotes have their original numbering, with added page number
to make them usable with the full Index. They are grouped at the end of
each Letter or Abstract.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title ="like this">Text lightly shaded in
violet</ins> indicates the site of a typographical error. Hover the
cursor over the shaded text, and the explanation should appear.
Typographical errors are listed again at the end of the Letter,
after any footnotes. In the primary text, errors were only
corrected if they are clearly editorial, such as missing italics, or
mechanical, such as <span class = "locked">u-for-n</span> misprints.
Italic “d” misprinted as “a” was a recurring problem. The word
“invisible” means that there is an appropriately sized blank space, but
the letter or punctuation mark itself is missing.</p>

<p><i>Some Specifics:</i> The spelling “Jhon” is not an error. Gresham
and Tresham are different people. Conversely, the inconsistent spelling
of the name “Lipyate” or “Lipgate” in footnotes is unchanged. In
Volume&nbsp;IV, the spelling “apostyle” for “apostille” is used
consistently.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman"><span class =

in October 1468 the Duchess of Suffolk had a design of suddenly entering
the manor of Cotton and dispossessing Sir John Paston. This letter, in
which it is said she proposes to hold a court there, was probably
written in the beginning of the following year.</p>

[The signature of this letter is written in an abbreviated form, ‘W.
Cot.’ According to Blomefield, W.&nbsp;Cotyng was rector of Titchwell
from 1450 to 1457, and he had been previously rector of Swainsthorp, to
which he was presented by Judge Paston in 1444. This letter is twelve
years later than the date at which his incumbency of Titchwell is said
to have terminated; but doubtless he is the writer. He is referred to as
living even in the year 1485, in a letter written by Dame Elizabeth
Browne, who says that he and James Gresham were clerks to her father
Judge Paston.]</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 308.] Sir Thomas Howes appears to have died in the
latter part of the year 1468. Before the end of that year his living of
Pulham was vacant, and his death is alluded to in a letter of Margaret
Paston’s, written on the 30th September 1469, as having occurred ‘within
this twelvemonth.’ It would appear by the following extract, quoted by
Fenn, from the Institution Books of the Bishop of Norwich, that Sir
John’s presentation referred to in this letter was not allowed, or was
not made out in time, and that the Bishop presented by a
lapse:&mdash;</p>

to Norfolk in 1469. Owing to the proposed marriage of Sir John Paston
with his kinswoman, Anne Haute, Lord Scales appears at this time to have

[From Fenn, iv. 322.] This and the following letter were printed by Fenn
from contemporaneous copies, written on the same paper without signature
or address. On the back, however, is the following
memorandum:&mdash;‘Copea litērz Dñi de Scales;’ to which has been added
in a later handwriting: ‘ad Conciliū Duc’ Norff’ et aliis (<i>sic</i>)
in favore J.&nbsp;Paston mil. eo quod maritaret cognatā suam Annā
Hawte.’ The date is clearly in the year 1469, when the Duke of Norfolk
laid claim to Caister.</p>

<p>I would have been with you on Sunday before Ascension Day, had I

you, nevertheless, for the safeguard of my sureties. Gives an account of
monies disbursed since parting with Sir John at London. Repaid ‘my

Delivered ‘to the master of the college onward for his hire,’
50<i>s.</i> Has received of Paston’s ‘lifelode’ since he came from
London but £18, 10<i>s.</i> Has spent £12, 10<i>s.</i> more than he
received, and has borrowed of John Wellys and others. Could borrow
nothing of Mr. William. ‘And of all this twelvemonth I have not had one
penny for my wages. There is none of them that hath purveyed nor
chevised have so much as I have done. Here is no man paid of their
wages, but all spent in household.’ Cannot get a penny in all Suffolk or
Flegge, of Paston’s ‘lifelode,’ nor in Boyton nor Heyneford. Can get
money only at Gughton, which I must gather myself, for the bailiff will
not come there. Much malt made, which had better be sold to pay the
men’s wages, who complain grievously, ‘and the master of the college and
Sir John Stille both.’ Will obtain for Dawbeney in ten days 6 or 7 marks
more, which should keep the household for the next seven or eight weeks.
The price of malt is but 20<i>d.</i> a quarter, but it would be better
to sell some than that the men should be unpaid. Wonders he has no word
from him about letting Spoorle. Cannot give Mariot an estate in Bekham
as Paston directs, for Paston has the deed which James Andrewes sealed,
but will talk with him and see how he is disposed; for it would be well
that Paston were through with him. He is not trusty, but seeks pretexts

and if they woll in no wise agree therto, betwix God, the Deelf, and
them be it, and that perell that we schuld be in, I&nbsp;beseche Godde

remembre ther disposicion, God sende them grace to gyde all thyngs
weele, as wele I wolde they dede; Godde be ther gide, and sende them
peas and reste,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p>I mervell moche that they schulde take this mater so heedely as I
undrestonde they doo, remembryng it is in suche case as it can not be
remedyed, and my desert upon every be halfe it is for to be thought ther
shulde be non obstacle a yenst it; and also the worchipfull that is in
them, is not in your mariage, it is in ther owne mariage, weche I
beseche Godde sende hem suche as may be to ther worschip and plesur to
Godde, and to ther herts ease, for ell[es] were it gret pety. Mastres,

[From Fenn, ii. 16.] The King’s visit to Norfolk and the creation of
Lord Stafford as Earl of Devonshire both fix the date of this letter as
1469. The writer seems to be the brother of Anne Hawte, to whom Sir John
Paston was engaged, and he accordingly calls him his brother.</p>

for the Lord Revers, he seyd to myn oncyll William, Fayrfax, and me,
that he shold meve the Kyng to spek to the two Dukys of Norffolk and
Suffolk, that they shold leve of ther tytyls of syche lond as wer Syr
John Fastolfs. And if so be that they wold do nowt at the Kyngs reqwest,
and then the Kyng shold comand theym to do no wasts, nor mak non
assawtys nor frayis upon your tenants nor plasys, tyll syche tym as the
lawe hathe determynd with yow or ayenst yow; this was seyd by hym the

Kyng with it or nowt I can not sey, myn oncyll Wyllyam thynkys naye. And
the same aftyr none folowyng I told my Lord Scalys that I had spokyn
with my Lord hys fadyr, in lyek forme as I

have rehersyd, and axyd hym whedyr that my Lord hys fadyr had spokyn to
the Kyng or nowt, and he gave me thys answer, that whedyr he had spokyn
to the Kyng or nowt, that the mater shold do well inow.</p>

<p>Thomas Wygfeld told me, and swore on to me, that when Brandon meuvyd
the Kyng, and besowght hym to shew my Lord favour in hys maters ayenst
yow, that the Kyng seyd on to hym ayen, ‘Brandon, thow thou can begyll
the Dwk of Norffolk, and bryng hym abow the thombe as thow lyst,
I&nbsp;let the wet thow shalt not do me so; for I undyrstand thy fals
delyng well inow.’ And he seyd on to hym, more over, that if my Lord of
Norffolk left not of hys hold of that mater, that Brandon shold repent
itt, every vayn in hys hert, for he told hym that he knew well inow that
he myght reauyll [<i>rule</i>] my Lord of Norffolk as he wold; and if my
Lord dyd eny thyng that wer contrary to hys lawys, the Kyng told hym he
knew well inow that it was by no bodys menys but by hys; and thus he
depertyd fro the Kyng.</p>

<p>Item, as by wordys, the Lord Scalys and Syr John Wydwyll tok tendyr
your maters mor then the Lord Revers.</p>

<p>Item, Syr John Wydvyll told me, when he was on horsbak at the Kyngs
depertyng, that the Kyng had comandyd Brandon of purpose to ryd forthe
fro Norwych to Lyne, for to tak a conclusyon in your mater for yow; and
he bad me that I shold cast no dowghtys but that ye shold have your
entent, and so dyd the Lord Scalys also; and when that I preyd them at
eny tyme to shew ther favor to your mater, they answered that it was
ther mater as well as yours, consyderyng, the alyans<a class = "tag"

betwen the Duk of Suffolks consell, and hym, and me; it is to long to

<p>Item, the Kyng rod thorow Heylysdon Waren towads Walsyngham, and

Contrary to thys maters, and all the comfort that I had of my Lord
Scalys, Sir John Wydvyll, and Thomas Wyngfeld, myn oncyll Wylliam sethe
that the Kyng told hym hys owne mowthe, when he had redyn for by the
loge in Heylysdon Waren, that he supposyd as well that it myght fall
downe by the self as be plukyd downe, for if it had be plukyd down, he
seyd that we myght have put in our byllys of it, wehn hys jugys sat on
the <i>oyeer determyner</i> in Norwyche, he beyng ther. And then myn
oncyll seythe how that he answered the Kyng, that ye trustyd to hys good
grace that he shold set yow thorow with both the Dwkys, by mene of
trete; and he seythe that the Kyng answerd hym that he wold neythyr tret
nor spek for yow, but for to let the lawe proced, and so he seyth that
they depertyd. And by my trowthe, and my Lord Tresorer encorage you not
more than he dyd us her, ye shall have but esy [<i>indifferent</i>] help
as on that party. Wherfor labor your maters effectually; for by my
trowthe it is nedy[s], for, for all ther wordys of plesur, I&nbsp;cannot

servyse for that seson to my Lady, but it was refusyd, I&nbsp;wot by

Broom, and W.&nbsp;Calthorp, ar sworn my Lord of Glowsetyrs men, but I

[From Fenn, ii. 40.] The dates of Edward the Fourth’s privy seals show
that he was at Nottingham in July 1469. He was not there in 1470, the
year to which Fenn assigns these letters; and both Clarence and Warwick
were then in France. It would appear, therefore, that these letters were
written at the time of Robin of Redesdale’s rebellion, which the King
was going northwards to suppress.</p>

Fenn thinks this was Dr. John Saresson, otherwise Wigenhale, who, he
tells us, was Chancellor to the Bishop from 1435 to 1471, and had other
Church preferment in the Diocese. But&nbsp;I am a little doubtful
whether he lived so long, as it does not appear that he kept any other
of his preferments to so late a date. We know that Dr. William Pykenham

was a process sued by the nearest relative of a person killed. It was

Letter in English from W. Wyrcestre to Bishop Wayneflete.&mdash;Has been

farmers there will take it without guarantees from Sir John Paston and
Sir William Yelverton in writing against any distraint. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.

been at charges ten years in London, and in riding on the infinite
process of ‘my Maister Fastolf’s testament yn the court of audience.’ Is
now obliged to retire from London to Cambridge in order to live cheaply.
Had been promised 25 marks on Paston’s behalf, 20 marks for ever of
Fastolf’s lands, 5&nbsp;marks of fee for his life, and £15 worth of land
for ever. Has not had clearly 8 marks.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 438.] This letter does not properly belong to the Paston
correspondence. It was copied by Fenn from an original in the library of
Brigg Price Fountaine, Esq. of Narford, in Norfolk, nephew and heir of
the celebrated antiquary, Sir Andrew Fountaine. The <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span> was contained in a volume of State Papers, some
of them originals, and some copies, of various dates, which had belonged
to Sir Edward Coke.</p>

<p>The date of the document is undoubtedly in September 1470, when
Edward was at York, anticipating the invasion of Clarence and the Earl
of Warwick, aided by the King of France.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 288.] This letter was probably written in or about the
year 1470. Anne Paston, the sister of John Paston, here mentioned, was
married to William Yelverton, a&nbsp;grandson of the Judge, in 1474
(Itin. W.&nbsp;Wyrc. 369), and the match had been already determined
(as&nbsp;will appear in a future letter) before June 1472. At the date
of this letter she was still staying in Calthorpe’s household, into
which, after the manner of the times, she had been sent for her
education; and Calthorpe desiring to reduce his establishment,
suggested, somewhat earlier than her mother anticipated, that it was
time to provide a husband for her.</p>

This is another entry from the old index of deeds in Magdalen College,
Oxford. There is probably some slight error in the date, as
Edward&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">IV.</span> was not acknowledged
as King on the 10th April, in what would otherwise have been the
eleventh year of his reign. He was so acknowledged a few days
later&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> after the battle of Barnet, which was fought on
the 14th April&mdash;so that if the date had been, say, April 20,
instead of April 10, it would have been quite consistent. It is
impossible, however, to say where the error lies, so we place the
document under the date actually expressed in it.</p>

[From Fenn, ii. 68.] The signature of this letter is composed of
flourishes which were probably devised on purpose to make it
unintelligible. Fenn suggests that the first character may be taken for
an O, and the last for a D; but to our thinking the resemblance is
rather difficult to trace. There is, however, great probability in his
conjecture that the writer was the Earl of Oxford, and the date just
after the battle of Barnet.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 116.] From the mention of Lord Scales in this letter it
might be supposed that it was written not later than the year 1469, when
Anthony Woodville, the last Lord Scales, became Earl Rivers by the death
of his father; but I believe the date to be 1471, and that the writer is
simply speaking of Earl Rivers by his old title. In the first place
there is no appearance of either of the John Pastons requiring a royal
pardon before the year 1471; secondly, it is not probable that either of
them would have spoken so slightingly of the value of Lord Scales’s
intercession at an earlier period; and thirdly, it seems doubtful
whether Edmund Paston could have been old enough to own a war-horse many
years before. Finally, we find by <a href = "#letter780">Letter 780</a>
following that John Paston, the youngest, succeeded in obtaining a
pardon signed by the King on the 17th July 1471. If the reference to the
autograph plate in Fenn is correct, this letter was in the hand of his
elder brother, Sir John Paston, Knight; but as it is not signed, like
most of his letters, ‘John Paston, K.,’ we are inclined to suspect that
it was really written by the younger brother, like <a href =
"#letter780">No.&nbsp;780</a>.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 440.] In the postscript to the preceding letter, Sir
John Paston intimates his belief that the two widows who had appealed
his brother of the murder of their husbands had married again, and that
thereby the appeals were abated. It appears by the present letter that
this intelligence was correct as regards one of them.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] There was a
general pardon in the latter part of the year 1471, and both John Paston
and his brother took advantage of it, as appears by the <i>Pardon
Roll</i>, 11 Edw. <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span>, membranes 9 and
25. The date of this letter is also shown by the answer to it, written
by Margaret Paston on the 5th November. Many of the words in this letter
are lost by the mutilation of the original <span class =

exposed at one time to damp. The address is almost completely lost, but
a portion of the word ‘[Ma]rgaret’ is visible, and a small fragment of
an endorsement below in which the word ‘Paston’ is legible.</p>

[At the date of this letter, Sir John Paston and his brother John were
together in London, and apparently the Archbishop of Canterbury was
seriously ill. Of the latter fact we have no certain knowledge, but it
appears by a subsequent letter that there was a report of his death in
June 1472, and the two brothers were certainly in London together in
November of the year preceding. It is probable therefore that the
Archbishop was ill of the epidemic which prevailed in the latter part of
1471 and the spring of 1472. The two brothers were not together in
November 1472.]</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This seems to
be only a portion of a letter, beginning in the middle of a sentence.
Probably it was a second leaf added to a more lengthy epistle. It is
written on one side of a slip of paper and is in the hand of John Paston
the younger. It is endorsed ‘John Paston’ in that of his brother Sir
John, to whom it was doubtless addressed. The date must be towards the
end of the year 1471, as it appears by the letter immediately following
that Lord Rivers embarked for Portugal that year on Christmas Eve.</p>

was kept on the 21st of January; her second festival was on the 28th of
the same month, which it is to be observed was not the octave of the
former, but a distinct feast upon a different occasion, and it is
sometimes written ‘Agnetis Nativitas’; but it was on account of a

And I thankyd hem in your name, and told them that ye wold have noo
voyse as thys day, for ye supposyd not to be in Inglond when the
Perlement shold be, and so they cam not at the sherhous
[<i>shire-house</i>]; for if they had, it was thought by syche as be
your frends here, that your adversarys wold have reportyd that ye had
mad labor to have ben one, and that ye koud not bryng your purpose
abowght.</p>

<p>I sent to Yermowthe, and they have promysyd also to Doctor Aleyn and
John Russe to be mor then iij. wekys goo.</p>

From the anxiety here expressed for a hawk, we may judge of the
attention which was paid to the diversion of hawking. Latham, in his
book of Falconry, says that a goshawk is the first and most esteemed
kind of hawk; that a sore hawk is from the first taking of her from the
eyry till she hath mewed her feathers. The tassel, or tiercel, is the
male of the goshawk, so called because it is a tierce or third less than
the female; it appears here, that a ‘grosser,’ or dealer in foreign
fruits, etc., sold hawks.&mdash;F.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This petition
is shown by internal evidence to have been drawn up towards the end of
the year 1472, as it sets forth that the Duke had been more than three
years in possession of Caister, which was surrendered to him in
September 1469. There can be no doubt therefore that it was presented or
prepared for presentation at the time of John Paston’s visit to
Framlingham.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] The allusion
by the writer to her cousin Berney’s sickness makes it probable that
this letter was written in 1473, when the Monday after St. Hilary would
be the 18th of January. John Berney of Reedham died on the 20th January
in that year (Inquis. <i>post mortem</i>, 13 Edw. <span class =
"smallroman">IV.</span>, No.&nbsp;17). The letter has neither signature
nor address, but was probably written by Margaret Paston to her priest,
Sir James Gloys, who died in the course of this year.</p>

certainly lived during her later years, and where she was doubtless
staying when she desired a license of the Bishop to have the Sacrament

As I promised in the letter that Playter sent, Playter and I have been
with my mother to get her to make chevesance for the £100, but she bade
us send you word, you need look for no other comfort from her. Jwde can
tell you Barker’s answer. As for John Kook you promised him payment
yourself and to Sir John Styll 5 marks in part payment. My mother has
sold her barley for 14<i>d.</i> I never meet John Smyth but I speak of
it to him. He keeps his courts here at Norwich all the week. As for
Fastolf, I&nbsp;can only speak to Wymondham his father-in-law, which I
do as often as I see him. Would be sorry the great matter which requires
hasty answer ‘lest the kok be in perayle’ should be delayed by his
negligence. Thinks Edmund Fastolf ‘was a reasonable man to Robert of
Lyne. Wherefore, let my brother Edmund sue for the same, for one wife
may serve for us both till better peace be. So God help me ye may allege
a plain excuse that these dyrk wars have so hindered me that her
lyvelode and mine both should be too little to live at our ease till I
were further before the hand than I could be this two year, and she
found after her honor and my poor appetite.’ Would rather forbear what
he would have than bring them in pain. ‘Say better for me, for ye can
and ye will. This matter must be honestly handled, for I wot well my
young lady of Oxenforthe shall hear of it. We have here no tidings, but
a few Frenchmen be whyrlyng on the coasts, so that there dare no fishers
go out but under safe conducts. I&nbsp;pray you, and ye have any more
oranges than ye occupy, that poor men may have part for a great bellied

[From Fenn, ii. 296.] I cannot discover in what year John Paston could
have been staying at Guisnes during the month of April at the request of
Lord Hastings, unless it was in the year 1474. There seems no other
probable year in which we have not distinct evidence of his being
elsewhere.</p>

the gentleman here referred to was John Berney of Reedham, Esquire, who

[From Fenn, iii. 426.] This letter was wrongly attributed by Fenn to
Edmund Paston, son of the Judge. It is in the hand of the Judge’s
grandson, also named Edmund, and was written at a time when his mother
Margaret was living at Mautby, where he, the writer, was also at the
time, though he expected to join his brother John, to whom he writes, in
the following week. These circumstances strongly suggest that it was
written in 1475, when Margaret Paston certainly was residing at Mautby,
as we find Edmund Paston with his brother John in London a month later
preparing to go over to Calais. <i>See</i> <a href =

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This letter
must have been written in the year 1475, when, as will be seen by
<a href = "#letter871">No.&nbsp;871</a>, some of Sir John Paston’s
brothers, among whom doubtless were both John and Edmund, to whom this
letter is addressed, were going over to Calais. The Bishop of Lincoln
(Rotherham) was Chancellor in 1475. It is true the Great Seal was taken
from him on the 27th April, and given to Alcock, Bishop of Rochester,
until the 28th September, when it was restored to Rotherham. But it is
certain this letter could not have been written in a later year, as the
Duke of Norfolk died in January 1476.</p>

[From a <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> in the Bodleian Library.]
The Castle of Caister was surrendered to the Duke of Norfolk in
September 1469, but he must have been taking the rents of the manor for
a year or two before. From what is stated in this petition, the Duke
must have given it up again in the end of the year 1470, <i>i.e.</i>
during the restoration of Henry&nbsp;<span class =
"smallroman">VI.</span>; but he entered again after half a year, and the
date of this second entry is given by William Worcester as the 23rd June
1471. After this, the petition says, he kept possession for four years
and more, so that the date of the document must be towards the close of
the year 1475. The Duke died on the 17th January 1476.</p>

[From Fenn, ii. 186.] This letter is not addressed, but must have been
intended for the writer’s brother John, or else, as Fenn suggests, for
his mother, Margaret. Sir John, however, ends by saying, ‘Within four
days I hope to see you’; and it appears by next letter that he was
actually with his brother at Norwich within <i>three</i> days, whereas
he paid no visit to his mother, who seems to have been living, as she
had done for some time, at Mautby. This letter must have been written
from Framlingham, whither Sir John had doubtless gone to petition the
Duke of Norfolk about Caister.</p>

is shown by internal evidence to have been written shortly after the
Duke of Norfolk’s death, which, as we have seen, took place on the 17th
January 1476. It was written on a Sunday, and states that Sir John
Paston had left Norwich the day before. The letter following, which is
of the 23rd January, is dated by John Paston, ‘Tuesday next after your
(Sir John’s) departing,’ so that the Sunday on which this was written

meetly to be clerk of your kechyn, whyche persone is now in servyse with
Master Fitzwater, and was befor that with Whethyll at Gwynes, and
purveyor for hys house, and at syche tyme as the Kynges grace was ther
last in hys vyage towardes France. Thys man is meane of stature, yonge
inough, well wittyd, well manerd, a&nbsp;goodly yong man on horse and

perfite in Flemyshe. He can wryght and reed. Hys name is Rychard
Stratton; hys modyr is Mastress Grame of Caleys. And when I had shewyd

your lordshepp to accept hym in to your servyse; wherto I promysed hym

foorthe for ever, whyll hys lyff wyll last, with ought grugeing or
contraying your comandement and plesure, in eny wyse that is in hym

<p>I shewed on to hym that I had preyed Master Talbot to be a mean to

that your lordshepp wer content to take hys servyse, then that it wold
please Mr. Talbot to meve my Lady of Norffolkes grace to wryght or send
to Bernard, puttyng hym in knowlage that hyr grace is content that he
shall become your menyall servaunt. Wherof he was passyng well pleasyd;

wyll he do; but, your lordshepe so pleasid, leve wer bettyr. Rychard
Stratton told me that whyll he was in servyse with Whethyll, John Redwe

not be so good mastyr to hym as to meve your lordshepe for hym.</p>

[Add. <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> 34,889, f. 188.] Strangely
enough there is no mention elsewhere of the serious illness of young
John Paston mentioned in this letter, by which we might fix the year
when it was written. But perhaps we may surmise that it was 1476, after
he had been at Calais, where he was expected in the spring. The fact
that he was ill at Attleborough agrees with this supposition, for that
was the seat of the Fitzwalter family, and ‘Master Fitzwalter’ is
mentioned in <a href = "#letter888">No.&nbsp;888</a> as at Calais
showing much interest in the Paston family. It may be observed also that
in 1476, Friday ‘next’ the Decollation of St. John Baptist (29th August)
would be the very next day.</p>

first of a series of letters, some of which were certainly written in
February 1477, relating to the engagement of John Paston to Margery
Brews. How early they began it is not easy to say precisely. On the back
of this letter is written, apparently in the hand of John Paston, to
whom it is addressed, ‘Letræ dominæ Elyzabethæ Brews et Margariæ filæ

[From Fenn, ii. 208.] It is clear from internal evidence that this
letter was written between the 7th and the 12th of February, and the
fact that St. Valentine’s Day (the 14th) fell on Friday, proves the year
to have been 1477. Besides which, we have distinct references to the

[From Fenn, ii. 256.] It is curious that after so much negotiation for
the marriage of John Paston and Margery Brews, we have no record in
these letters when it actually took place; but probably it was in August
1477, the last reference to it as an event not yet accomplished being on
the 7th of that month (<a href = "#letter916">No.&nbsp;916</a>). In
January 1478, John Paston talks of taking his wife to her father’s house
on account of her situation, and their first child was born in the
course of the following summer. This letter seems to have been written
in December. Fenn remarks that St. Thomas’s Day might mean the
Translation of St. Thomas à Becket, 7th July 1478, and ‘Our Lady’s Day’
might be the Visitation of the Virgin, 2nd July preceding. But this is
simply impossible, because the letter is dated Thursday <i>before</i>
St. Thomas’s Day, which would in that case be the very same date as the
Visitation of Our Lady, viz. the 2nd July 1478. Besides, if the first
child of John Paston and Margery was not actually born before July, the
latter was certainly much nearer to her confinement then than this
letter would imply. <i>See</i> No.&nbsp;936 in vol. vi.</p>

<p>A facsimile of this letter was published in the <i>European
Magazine</i> for March 1787, and we have carefully compared the text
with this facsimile.</p>

Fenn suggests <i>Grenouilliere</i> or frog-colour, but I find no
authority for such a word<!-- ie, he’s making things up -->; and I
should suppose ‘grene’ to be a separate word, though what ‘a&nbsp;lyer’
is I cannot say.</p>
